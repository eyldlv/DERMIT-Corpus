# Gold Standard
A set of 600 parallel sentences (German-Romansh), manually annotated for word alignment. 

The annotations were created by a single annotator (me) using [AlignMan](https://github.com/steinst/AlignMan).
If you wish to contribute as a second annotator, you can download [alignments.db](./alignments.db)
and make your annotations using [my fork of AlignMan](https://github.com/eyldlv/AlignMan).
